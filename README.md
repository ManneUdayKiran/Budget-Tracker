## 🧠 Describe Your Approach

This project was built with a simple and intuitive interface in mind. Users input their expenses, which are stored in arrays and immediately reflected in a live Chart.js pie chart. Each entry is listed below the chart with a delete button that allows removing specific entries while keeping the chart updated. Random colors are generated for each new entry for better visualization.
